1,"I bought 2 pairs of these shoes at the same time: 1x white leather size. 44 and 1x black leather Gr. 44. Both pairs show severe wear after a short time, i.e. holes in the inner lining in the heel area, although they were not worn very often. To be honest, I have never experienced such rapid wear and tear in branded sports shoes.",22 Αυγ 2022

4,"My son loved designing his own shoe and was really happy with the way it came out. His only issue was the creases on the left shoe. He's always been extremely careful to prevent creases in his Air Forces so he was disappointed to see them already in his new shoe! I hope they hold up as well as the regular ones. Overall, he loves it though.",21 Ιουλ 2022
1,The show was too bulky and it creased too much,18 Ιουλ 2022

5,I can't tell you how many pairs I have had of the triple white ones. They are timeless and can be combined with almost any style.,5 Ιουλ 2022
1,I've worn the shoes 4 times and it's already ripping on both. Low quality,1 Ιουλ 2022
5,This is a great shoe that you can match with sweats or jeans. 5 stars!!!,28 Ιουν 2022
5,"Great, stylish shoe that goes with any outfit. Hard to get in popular sizes, but if you check every morning when you wake up, you will eventually get a pair.",26 Ιουν 2022
5,All hands down the best shoe ever,23 Ιουν 2022
5,"According to the size chart, I'm actually US 9.5 and wear other shoes in this size, but I got the AF1 in a 9 and they fit perfectly in terms of length. Despite being half a size smaller, they sit relatively loose. Believe me, if you have ""normal"" feet, definitely take half a size smaller.
But the shoe looks very cool.",11 Ιουν 2022
1,"The ones made in India is just uncomfortable to wear. Not the same quality as the made in Vietnam I had before. Edges are rough, I have several pressure points in my feet. The tongue digs into my feet and the inside also. Waste of money",4 Ιουν 2022
5,"Excellent, comfortable and super beautiful pair of shoes. Free delivery and above all extremely fast. Complicated to have at its size, but once possessed we do not regret this pair.",31 Μαΐ 2022

5,"I love these, but they definitely run big. I wear a 9 in almost every Nike I have, and I had to get these in an 8. Hopefully this helps someone.",27 Μαΐ 2022
5,"I can’t tell you how many times I’ve bought a pair of AF1’s, but I can tell you each pair has been the best sneaker I’ve ever bought. Doesn’t matter the silhouette, color, or year, since about ‘97, the AF1 has been a staple in my closet.",27 Μαΐ 2022

Very satisfied!",9 Μαΐ 2022
5,100% true to size. I was going to downsize half a size because of all the reviews I read but thank god I didn't because it is true to size. I think if I'd choose the second best fit it would be the half a size UP lol,7 Μαΐ 2022
5,"Just as I expected. Reliable comfort, and still cool. I was very impressed by the quality, all seams and overlays are stitched nicely and evenly. Everything is symmetrical, and no glue visible anywhere. I love them so much, I built and ordered a custom pair. Can't wait for those to arrive. Not many leather sneaks out there anymore, please do not ever discontinue this classic model.",28 Απρ 2022
2,"a bit of a narrow toebox not wide by any stretch, half size up if you are wide the quality of the made in india marked boxes have been sub par and less than ideal with glue spots and defects throughout the shoes in the examples i had purchased",24 Απρ 2022
5,One of the best shoes. Honestly you can wear these things with about any outfit/ any color. Happy to have been purchasing Air force ones for about 10 years now.,13 Απρ 2022
3,"I do not know why. Same size, men's shoe doesn't fit at all at the heel.
Others were good, except that terrible experience.",11 Απρ 2022

I love this shoe, especially because it can go with a lot of different outfits and it looks good on basically everyone. They reason I gave it a 4 star, instead of a 5 star is because the shoes gets damaged over time. It is visual damage and can't really hide it because it's all white.

5,These are a hood favorite and ultimately classic. Would definitely recommend,5 Μαΐ 2021
3,The day before the shoes arrived I found out that the shoes run big so yeah that really messed me up. Also what’s up with the shoes taking one week to arrive that’s ridiculous. My recommendation is to get one size below your actual size when you get the shoes. I got a size 11 when I should’ve got a size 10.5. Now I have to wait another week. Once again ridiculous.,3 Μαΐ 2021

5,Classic shoe,29 Μαρ 2021
5,All time classic,24 Μαρ 2021
4,I had a pair of AF1's back in mid-2000's and loved them but eventually wore them out and moved to a few different pairs of trainers. Getting a pair brought back all the memories of the late teenage years while still being stylish (or retro enough) to wear out on a frequent basis again. Though I've had to trade in my trainers for slacks and dress shoes - I still like to unwind in something more,16 Μαρ 2021
4,My husband really liked the look and feel of these Nike shoes. The only problem is that they do run small. My husband usually wears a 11 in tennis shoes and these were too small. He would need an 11.5-12 in these Nike Air Force 1s. It may just be this style of shoe because they are very stiff and narrow. The quality looks to be very good. I will come back to update my review on the longevity,15 Μαρ 2021
4,"Overall these are a quality pair of shoes. They are quite sturdy, but broke in well after only about 30 minutes of walking around town. Fit is just right and quite comfortable. I could easily wear these all day. And I love an all black sneaker (tiny bit of silver bling at the base of the laces is a nice addition)! What I'm still not sure about it the thickness of the sole. From the box, they",14 Μαρ 2021
5,"I love the classic look of these iconic shoes. The black on black looks really sharp! These are great shoes for everyday wear, or even to work out in. They are comfortable and light on the foot, and provide a nice amount of cushion. The toe box took a couple of days to break in, but now is extremely comfortable. This is a great all around every day wear shoe that goes with almost everything!",9 Μαρ 2021
5,"My husband is a Nike fanatic and absolutely loves these Air Force 1s! They are a classic design that won’t ever go out of style. He likes that the black-on-black goes with everything (athletic wear or jeans!) and it hides blemishes really well (so he isn’t constantly afraid of getting them dirty!)

He is a big fan of the cushion in the heel that this shoe provides. The sole did feel a bit",7 Μαρ 2021
4,"AF1. What more can I say - these are the best and haven't aged at all. I always size up by half a size, but that's my own preference rather than a requirement. Enjoy your AF1's!",7 Μαρ 2021
4,"The Air Force 1 is a solid color shoe that was comfortable for my husband to wear. He said it felt fine wearing it around. His only complaint was the toe box was more narrow, which squeezed his toes slightly. He said he would go up half a size next time and see if that would feel better. The length of the shoe was right, just the width that was a problem. The comfort of the padding was spot on",7 Μαρ 2021
5,"The real OG, had a pair of these literally ever since I started my obsession with sneakers. Look great regardless brand new or beaten.",6 Μαρ 2021
3,"I got this shoe for my husband. He has worn Nike shoes in the past and was interested in trying out this new, yet old classic. Overall he said the fit was large and he would recommend sizing down a half size. The shoe is quite heavy, feels very stiff when wearing, and does not provide much movement or support for the foot. It also has a thinner foot bed, which makes wearing it for longer periods",5 Μαρ 2021
4,"All black AF1s are one of the all time classic kicks. I like the new metal emblem on the laces that I don’t remember from before. Helps give a subtle piece to stand out against the all black shoe. The comfort remains great, especially the padding around the top where it hits the ankle. Just got these, but they feel as quality and as durable as they were back 15 years ago. A little heavy, but if",5 Μαρ 2021
5,My husband never gets nice shoes and usually isn’t into brands. He was skeptical but ended up really loving this product. He says they are comfortable and feel sturdy like they are going to last long but also keep his feet “together” while not feeling tight. He usually has to wear 10.5 wide but the 10.5 regular fits him great. Was able to wear it all day without any issues. It’s a nice black and the small silver emblem doesn’t look tacky.,4 Μαρ 2021
4,"The Nike Air Force 1 are a great pair of ahleisure sneakers. They’re very well made, have soft leather and a thick sole and are good and sturdy. They’re both functional and stylish. I have the black on black and they could easily be dressed up or down. When first putting them on they felt stiff but they softened up and felt great even after wearing them all day. The only reason for 4 stars is that",4 Μαρ 2021
4,"I obtained a pair of Nike Air Force 1 in black, and their simple, understated design makes them a versatile complement to the ""polo shirt and khakis"" business casual ensemble we engineers spend the majority of our working lives wearing. They have been a welcome option to the black oxfords I normally wear around the office.

The thick rubber outsole and generous padding on the upper make",4 Μαρ 2021
4,I know that the Air Force 1's are a very popular shoe so I was excited to give them a try. I normally wear a size 13 in Nike's and they fit perfectly but these were way to big. I could size down a couple sizes and have room. I think they would be great for wide feet. Regardless they are extremely comfortable. I can wear them all day without my feet getting tired. They did not rub anywhere. These shoes are really well made. I like that the black 1's can be dressed up or down.,4 Μαρ 2021
4,"I got a pair of Nike Air Force 1's in all black. These shoes are very comfortable and appear to be durable. The shoe pairs well with many fits of jeans, such as skinny or bootcut. I love that I can also pair these shoes with khakis for a night out or with joggers to head to the gym. People of all ages can pull these shoes off. Don't be afraid to venture out of your typical shoe style--Try",3 Μαρ 2021
4,"These shoes bring me back to the originals! They are an iconic shoe that is able to bring back anyone to the first time you ever wore a pair like this. The great thing about this shoe is that it’s simple, you can dress this shoe up and still be fashion forward. It also screams style for that dad in you. Who wanted to see a dad rocking Air Force 1s. The first time you put this shoe on your feet will be screaming heck yes for the feel and the people around you will be wishing they had a pair.",2 Μαρ 2021
5,Love my new Air Force ones. Most guy athleisure shoes have zero comfort. These are the opposite of that. They look cool (or whatever the kids are saying these days) and are super comfy (let’s face it-probably more important). I got the black on black style which means they go with anything and everything. Fits true to size.,2 Μαρ 2021
3,"Shoes look great and seem durable, however, I was unable to test them properly as they run HUGE. I normally wear an 11 but I could not walk without them falling out. When trying them on they seem comfortable, but I can't justify if they will be comfortable over time as I was unable to use them for a long period of time due to the horrible fit.",2 Μαρ 2021
5,"Love the AF1s. Got them in all black to contrast my all white. Runs true to size and super comfortable. During the pandemic, I’m using them as my indoor shoes to keep my feet warm during the winter. Makes using my standing desk that much more comfortable when I have them on. Can’t wait to take them outside, as they match just about any outfit, once it is safe again.",1 Μαρ 2021
4,"This shoe sizes true to size on length. A little tight at the ball and forward, so if you have a wide foot would suggest sizing up.
The angle of the sole is comfortable. Nice and flat on the bottom of the shoe, and your foot is angled slightly downwards, which is how I like it.
The grip above your ankle is nice and tight. You'll feel it the first day, but it breaks in quickly and then you",1 Μαρ 2021

Typically Nike runs small to me and I also have a wide foot, so I usually get a Women's 8.5 or 9. For this particular purchase, I ordered a Men's 7 (W 8.5) and the fit was perfect, even with socks on. It's a great shoe and goes with just about any outfit.

Didn’t expect these trainers to be so comfortable, but with all positives you will naturally get a negative, and that is that the trainer is creasing way to easily but apart from that a trendy, iconic shoe",4 Ιουν 2019
5,The only down side about these shoes is that I usually am a 10.5. I ordered at 10. In all honesty I could have gone with a 9.5. Keep in mind I do have a very narrow foot and this is a wider shoe.,9 Απρ 2019
